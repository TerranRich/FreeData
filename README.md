# FreeData

Welcome! FreeData is a growing database of various sets of data (such as Unicode characters, U.S. surnames, etc.) in various formats (JSON, SQL, CSV, and XLSX). One day I thought to myself, "Wouldn't it be cool if there were one place where developers or anybody else could go for sets of public data?" There have been times when I've needed a list of surnames, a list of ZIP codes and their cities, a list of countries and their codes, and so many other sets of data that I would then have to scour the internet to find.

Well, that's where FreeData comes in. All data here has been sourced and compiled by myself, and provided completely for free (under GNU General Public License 3). Here's what FreeData offers so far:
